I am a PhD candidate in the **NLP & Society Lab** at Utrecht University, supervised by Dong Nguyen.  

My research focuses on **data diversity for fair and robust NLP**, combining:
- sociolinguistic perspectives on language variation, and  
- neural language modelling and evaluation.

Before my PhD, I completed an MSc in **Voice Technology** at the University of Groningen,
where I worked on improving **dysarthric speech recognition** using wav2vec 2.0 and language models.

Outside research, I care about accessibility, LGBTQ+ issues, and building tools that help
under-represented communities use language technologies.
