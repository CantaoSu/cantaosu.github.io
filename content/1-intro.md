## Current PhD project

My PhD project focuses on **measuring and leveraging data diversity** for fair and robust NLP.

I am particularly interested in:
- how **semantic diversity** in datasets can be quantified,
- how language variation (dialect, register, style) affects model behaviour,
- how to design **evaluation benchmarks** that reflect real-world diversity.

## Broader interests

- Speech & language technology for people with disabilities
- Pathological speech recognition and synthesis
- Evaluation of large language models
- Dataset documentation and ethics
