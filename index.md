# Hi, I'm Cantao 👋  

PhD candidate in the **NLP & Society Lab** at Utrecht University.  
I work on **data diversity for fair and robust NLP**, especially how language variation
(dialects, registers, styles) affects model performance and fairness.

I enjoy building tools that connect **sociolinguistics** and **neural language models**,
and thinking about how we can evaluate diversity in a principled way.
